# 1.Why do you think companies analyze large volumes of data?
# Companies analyze large datasets to make better decisions, identify trends, understand customer behavior, 
# improve efficiency, reduce costs, and increase profit. Data helps them predict future outcomes and stay competitive in the market.

# 2.If analyzing and sorting large data manually in Excel is difficult, how do you think Python can help solve this problem?
# Python can automate data analysis tasks using libraries like Pandas and NumPy. It can quickly process large datasets, 
# filter and sort information, perform calculations, and reduce human error. Tasks that take hours in Excel can be done
#  in seconds with Python scripts.

# 3.Imagine you work at a sales company that receives data about 10,000 customer transactions daily. How would you analyze this data?
# I would collect and store the data in a database, then use Python to clean and organize it. After that, 
# I would analyze sales trends, customer behavior, popular products, and daily revenue. Finally, I would visualize
#  the results using charts and dashboards to help management make decisions.

# 4.In your opinion, what tasks can Python be useful for in BI processes? (e.g., data cleaning, visualization, etc.)
# Python is useful for data cleaning, transformation, analysis, automation, statistical modeling, visualization,
#  report generation, and building dashboards. It also helps integrate data from different sources.

# 5.If you wanted to compare a company's profit year by year, how could this be done using Python?
# You could load the company’s financial data into Python using Pandas, group the data by year, 
# calculate total profit for each year, and then visualize the comparison using line or bar charts
#  with libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.

# 6.If you don't know Python, what difficulties might you face when working with large datasets?
# You may spend more time doing manual work, struggle with processing large files, make more errors,
#  and have limited ability to automate tasks or perform advanced analysis. It would also be harder 
# to build visualizations and extract insights efficiently.
